# Automatic-drip-irrigation
Automatic drip irrigation system 

## Intention
* Develop a low cost drip irrigation system

## general work flow
* measure soil moisture. 
* interpret the data and if soil moisture goes below 60% send signals to irrigation system (use wireless communication system)
* irrigation system receives the signal and send command to turn on motor starter.
* when motor started dripping will initiate 

## survey needs to be done
* find a suitable low cost,accurate soil moisture measurement sensor
* use a suitable microcontroller
* find suitable wireless communication technique

## TODO 
* develop as a low cost agro product
* add automatic fertilization along with irrigation
* add remote controlling the system for end users
* add remote software debugging
