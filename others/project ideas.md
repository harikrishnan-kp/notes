- develop a low cost IMU(inertia measurement unit): 
    - consist of an inertial measurement system(accelerometer,gyroscope and magnetometer) and its data processing system using any microcontroller
    - skill gaining areas
        - hardware system design,pcb routing
        - embedded programming
        - dsp and others
- develop a low cost temp,humidity lora node (as a product)
    - skill gaining areas
        - hardware system design,pcb routing
        - embedded programming
- develop a ROS2 driver for bosch BMX160 sensor
    - for running on raspberry pi and jetson nano
    - port wiringpi or other gpio library for this (only i2c and spi needed,bcz BMX160 only contains these)
    - create a single package that contain everything
- develop a code from scratch to read data from BMX160
    - skill gaining
        - how to read data from sensor
        - how to do it from scratch
        - how to write library
- football analysis using AI/ML
    - search football analysis in github
    - features required
        - position analyis of players 
        - individual player analysis from match video
            - heatmap, pass map, number of touches,no.of shots(on ans off target) etc
    - some reference repos
