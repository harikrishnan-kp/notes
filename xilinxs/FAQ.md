- how to create a custom os for kv260 using petalinux tool
- how to add dpu while building petalinux os
- how to create an os using yocto
- what is vitis platform
- Difference between Yocto and PetaLinux tools, how to install this, for what purpose this is used
- What is SYSROOT?
- What is ROOTFS used for?
- What is meant by device tree overlay
- What is the use of .dtbo file
- What is DTG(device tree generator) and DTC(device tree compiler)
    - DTG is a vitis tool for generating device tree(dts) file from XSA
    - we can find it from top menu, xilings >> generate device tree
    - it is also possible to generate dts from XSCT console,using createdtb command
    - DTC using to compile deviced tree source to dtbo
- What is XSCT
    - XSCT is a Console tool of Vitis. You can start it by typing xsct in Linux terminal to start it. Or, you can select menu Xilinx >> XSCT Console to start the XSCT tool after you launch Vitis.
- What is a BSP?
- What is the purpose of executing sdk.sh, what is it doing
    - it is installing sysroot,it helps in cross compilation
- Difference between various development flows...like Vitis Platform, Vitis Application, Vivado Platform, etc...all the items included in the first link I had sent you
- In which flow, your each work is falling to
Compare it with the Vitis-AI work you have done....which flow it is falling to
- What is meant by HLS
- Difference between Verilog/VHDL and the C++ code you have seen for stereolbm
- What is the difference between a normal C++ code and the one you have seen for stereolbm
- What is the difference between the stereolbm and stereolbm_tb programs you have seen in the source folder
- What happens when you run the Make. what is Make, and what is the use of Makefile...how to interpret the statements in the Makefile
- What are the different parameters to be set in the "env" for executing the cross compilation
- What is the difference between .xclbin and .xmodel files
- What is happening in the hardware when you execute these
- What is the Vivado platform work you have done
- Difference between a Vivado platform and Vitis platform
- What is .xsa file, .xpfm file, difference between the two
- How do you prepare the image for flashing into the SD card, which contains everything ready for execution
- What happens when you do the loadapp
    - Kria SOM uses xmutil to load applications dynamically
    - i think we are loading harware kernal to the existing system 
- Why we need to "source" the setup scripts?
- What is OpenCV
- Why do we need to set the OpenCV include library and load library?
- In the Vitis-AI flow, why did you use the Docker?
- What is a DPU?
- How do DL models run a DPU? What is meant by layer support?
- Do we need DPU for stereolbm execution?
- What is meant by AXI connection?
- What is OpenCL
    - OpenCLâ„¢ API calls to manage runtime interactions with the accelerator. The hardware component, or kernel, can be developed using C/C++, OpenCL C, or RTL
- What is the purpose of XRT?
- What is meant by VART, how it is different from XRT
