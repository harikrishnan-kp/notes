# Kria KV260 Vision AI Starter Kit
* Kria KV260 Vision is a development kit from AMD
* consist of [Kria K26 SOM](https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/products/som/kria/k26/k26-product-brief.pdf) (system on module) by AMD
* power supply : 12v, 3A
* K26 is based on the Xilinx `Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC` architecture, it has a Processing System (`PS`) + Programmable Logic (`PL`) architecture
* this PL section is the fpga section, we can use vivado for implimenting the hardware acceleration ( in our case AI accelerator)
* `DPU` deep learning processing unit,`DPUCZDX8G` is A specific Xilinx DPU variant.
* The KV260 Starter Kit has a primary and secondary boot device, isolating the boot firmware from the run-time OS and application
* The `First Stage Bootloader` (FSBL) for Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC `configures the FPGA` with the hardware bitstream (if it exists) and loads the Operating System (OS) Image, Standalone (SA) Image, 2nd Stage Boot Loader(u -boot) image from the non-volatile memory (NAND/SD/eMMC/QSPI) to memory (DDR/TCM/OCM), then takes A53/R5 out of reset

## OS support
* xlinx provides pe-built OS images like `ubuntu`, `embedded linux`(build using yocto) and `petalinux`.
* it is important that we should use the `boot firmware`(QSPI in SOM) recommended by a specific OS

* if we are using a custom hardware accelerator(on FPGA). we need to create a custom os which can interact with hardware accelerator
    * `petalinux` is an Embedded Linux development tool focused on Xilinx silicons and device specific feature enablement via board support packages (BSPs) and pre-built reference(s). 
    * `Yocto` is another tool to create our own fully custom embedded 
Linux. 




## Install pre-built OS
- download required OS images : https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/1641152513/Kria+SOMs+Starter+Kits#K26-Starter-Kit-Linux
- flash the image to SD card using belena etcher or other softwares
- After initial boot of a new SD card image it is best practice to execute `sudo dnf update` (PetaLinux) or `sudo apt update` (Ubuntu) in order to update core utilities
- update boot firmware if needed


## Boot FirmWare update with xmutil
- Download the required version of boot firmware file (BOOT.bin) from [link](https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/1641152513/Kria+SOMs+Starter+Kits#K26-Boot-Firmware-Updates).
- Move the BOOT.BIN file to the SOM Starter Kit target using SCP or rsync or FTP. Note the directory or location of the file.
-  boot fimware can be updated using `xmutils` or `boot image recovery tool`
- we are going to use xmutils here, Perform the following steps
```bash 
sudo xmutil bootfw_update -i <path to boot.bin>
```
- verify the update status using the 
```bash
sudo xmutil bootfw_status
```
- After this perform the Power cycling the board(reset or reboot)
- After restart it is required to verify the linux fully boots with the new boot FW
```bash
 sudo xmutil bootfw_update -v
```
## Hardware Accelerated Applications
Hardware acceleration means offloading specific computations from the CPU to specialized hardware like GPUs, FPGAs, or ASICs for improved performance, power efficiency, and parallel processing.
### steps to create hardware accelareted applications for kv260 
* In Vivado, create an FPGA logic for hardware acceleration(in PL) and its communication setup with the ARM CPU(PS)
* Export the IP block developed in vivado and integrate it into a Vitis platform.
* In Vitis, develop an application to control the FPGA logic from the CPU.
* load the FPGA configuration bitstream to SOC
* Run the Linux application to communicate with the FPGA accelerator.

The API calls, managed by XRT, are used to process transactions between the host program and the hardware accelerators. Communication between the host and the kernel, including control and data transfers, occurs across the PCIeÂ® bus or an AXI bus for embedded platforms. Control information is written to or read from specific address-mapped register in the kernels. Data buffers are exchanged between the host and kernels through global memory. Global memory is accessible by both the host processor and hardware accelerators, while host memory is only accessible by the host application.

## notes
- For best practice, the `sudo shutdown -h now` command should be executed before removing power to the board

## how to establish connection between kv260 and our host pc
- via serial ports communication using apps on host pc
    - [`GTKterm`](gtkterm.md)
- via point to point communication using LAN cable
    - to establish this communication we need setup serial port communication first
    - check details of the networks in our pc. note: in ubuntu 24.04 `eth0` is replaced by `enp2s0`
    - If DHCP is not available, you need to set the the IP address(0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 not sure) manually.
    - sudo ifconfig enp2s0 10.0.0.10 (on host )
    - ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.20 (on target)
    - ensure connectivity using ping  
- using SSH if the board has internet access 
## Setup DISPLAY
- The ideal setup is to connect a monitor using HDMI cable.
- export the display using the below command on kv260
```bash
export DISPLAY=[HOST_IP_ADDRESS]:0.0
```
- display for streaming video captured by camera module: on a host PC using a media player capable of handling an RTSP feed such as VLC or ffplay over the Ethernet cable.
