# Kria KV260 Vision AI Starter Kit
* Kria KV260 Vision is a development kit from AMD
* consist of [Kria K26 SOM](https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/products/som/kria/k26/k26-product-brief.pdf) (system on module) by AMD
* power supply : 12v, 3A
* K26 is based on the Xilinx `Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC` architecture, it has a Processing System (`PS`) + Programmable Logic (`PL`) architecture
* this PL section is the fpga section, we can use vivado for implimenting the hardware acceleration ( in our case AI accelerator)
* `DPU` deep learning processing unit,`DPUCZDX8G` is A specific Xilinx DPU variant.
* The KV260 Starter Kit has a primary and secondary boot device, isolating the boot firmware from the run-time OS and application
* The `First Stage Bootloader` (FSBL) for Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC `configures the FPGA` with the hardware bitstream (if it exists) and loads the Operating System (OS) Image, Standalone (SA) Image, 2nd Stage Boot Loader(u -boot) image from the non-volatile memory (NAND/SD/eMMC/QSPI) to memory (DDR/TCM/OCM), then takes A53/R5 out of reset
* Kria SOM has some ease-of-use designs for application developers. It provides software-like development experience on FPGA and SoC, such as real time reloading applications without rebooting the system.
* In order to allow updating PL design without rebooting Linux, it boots Linux from ARM Cortex-A53 and loads FPGA bitstream using Linux

## OS support
* pre-build OS:
    * xilinx provides pe-built OS images like `ubuntu`, `embedded linux` and `petalinux`.
    * it is important that we should use the `boot firmware`(QSPI in SOM) recommended by a specific OS
* custom OS: we can create custom OS using 
    * `petalinux` is an Embedded Linux development tool focused on Xilinx silicons and device specific feature enablement via board support packages (BSPs) and pre-built reference(s). 
    * `Yocto` is another tool to create our own fully custom embedded 
Linux. 

### Install pre-built OS
- download required OS images : https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/1641152513/Kria+SOMs+Starter+Kits#K26-Starter-Kit-Linux
- flash the image to SD card using belena etcher or other softwares
- After initial boot of a new SD card image it is best practice to execute `sudo dnf update` (PetaLinux) or `sudo apt update` (Ubuntu) in order to update core utilities (this step required internet access)
- update boot firmware if needed, check the status
    ```bash
    sudo xmutil bootfw_status
    ```


### Boot FirmWare update with xmutil
- Download the required version of boot firmware file (BOOT.bin) from [link](https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/1641152513/Kria+SOMs+Starter+Kits#K26-Boot-Firmware-Updates).
- Move the BOOT.BIN file to the SOM Starter Kit target using SCP or rsync or FTP. Note the directory or location of the file.
-  boot fimware can be updated using `xmutils` or `boot image recovery tool`
- we are going to use xmutils here, Perform the following steps
```bash 
sudo xmutil bootfw_update -i <path to boot.bin>
```
- verify the update status using the 
```bash
sudo xmutil bootfw_status
```
- After this perform the Power cycling the board(reset or reboot)
- After restart it is required to verify the linux fully boots with the new boot FW
```bash
 sudo xmutil bootfw_update -v
```

## Establish connection between kv260 and our host pc
- via serial ports communication using apps on host pc
    - [`GTKterm`](gtkterm.md)
- via point to point communication using LAN cable
    - to establish this communication we need setup serial port communication first
    - connect kv260 and host pc using LAN cable
    - check details of the networks in our PC and kv260
        ```
        ifconfig
        ``` 
        note: in ubuntu 24.04 `eth0` is replaced by `enp2s0`
    - If DHCP is not available, you need to set the the IP address(0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255) manually.
        - sudo ifconfig enp2s0 10.0.0.10 (on host )
        - ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.20 (on target)
    - ensure connectivity using ping  
    - now we can access kv260 terminal using SSH or we can use scp to transfer files to kv260
    - note: this process does not give internet access to kv260
    
## Setup DISPLAY (not verified yet)
- The ideal setup is to connect a monitor using HDMI cable.
- export the display using the below command on kv260 (line to line connection)
```bash
export DISPLAY=[HOST_IP_ADDRESS]:0.0
```
- display for streaming video captured by camera module: on a host PC using a media player capable of handling an RTSP feed such as VLC or ffplay over the Ethernet cable.


## shutting down
- For best practice, the `sudo shutdown -h now` command should be executed before removing power to the board
