- vivado is for creating custom IP blocks in FPGA(hardware accelerator + it's cummunication interface with PS).
- output of vivado is a hardware description file - `XSA` (xilings shell archive) it contain with clock, reset, AXI interface and interrupt signals and properties.
- These files are generated by Vivado to contain the required hardware information to develop embedded software with Vitis
- this XSA file is needed for `dtbo` file generation
- vivado support IP block integration using GUI tools 

## Create the Vivado Hardware Design and Generate XSA
create the hardware design for the KV260 Vitis acceleration platform
