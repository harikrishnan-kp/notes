- XSCT is a Console tool of Vitis. You can start it by typing xsct in Linux terminal
- Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC `ZCU104 Evaluation Kit` is using for IP validation
- seems like aarch64-xilinx-linux-gcc is the compiler using for compiling c program for xylinx
- varients of DPU IP `DPUCVDX8H` is using for AI acceleration

## doubts
- is it possible to impliment cpu cores on FPGA fabric 
    - yes,we can impliment cpu cores on FPGA fabric using VHDL/Verilog, it is called as `soft processor cores`.it has some pros and cons compared to `hard processor cores`
    - eg:
        - MicroBlaze (Xilinx) – A 32-bit RISC processor used in Xilinx FPGAs.
        - Nios II (Intel/Altera) – A configurable 32-bit soft-core for Intel FPGAs.
        - VexRISC-V – A small and efficient RISC-V soft-core.
        - PicoRV32 – A lightweight RISC-V implementation.
- we dont have to impliment a processor core for running apps in our FPGA fabric if we have a `hard processor core` in it 
- does GPU have a cpu in it: no
- are we creating general purpose applications or application for PS-PL communucation using vitis?
    - vitis can be Used for software development on the ARM Cortex-A53 cores (PS), including Linux applications, bare-metal firmware, and managing PS-PL communication.
- if we are using vitis for general purpose application development,why can't with other IDEs?
- Why Do We Feed the Vivado Bitstream to Vitis Before Development?
    - The reason for this is to ensure that the Processing System (PS) correctly recognizes and interacts with the Programmable Logic (PL).
    - Vitis uses the .xsa file to generate drivers and software APIs.
- what modifications are need to our OS if we add an hardware accelerator
