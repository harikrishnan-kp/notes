# Kria KV260 Vision AI Starter Kit
* Kria KV260 Vision is a development kit from AMD
* consist of [Kria K26 SOM](https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/products/som/kria/k26/k26-product-brief.pdf) (system on module) by AMD
* power supply : 12v, 3A
* K26 is based on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC architecture, it has a Processing System (PS) + Programmable Logic (PL) architecture
* this PL section is the fpga section, we can use vivado for implimenting the hardware acceleration ( in our case AI accelerator)
* `DPU` deep learning processing unit
* The KV260 Starter Kit has a primary and secondary boot device, isolating the boot firmware from the run-time OS and application
* The `First Stage Bootloader` (FSBL) for Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC `configures the FPGA` with the hardware bitstream (if it exists) and loads the Operating System (OS) Image, Standalone (SA) Image, 2nd Stage Boot Loader image from the non-volatile memory (NAND/SD/eMMC/QSPI) to memory (DDR/TCM/OCM), then takes A53/R5 out of reset
* we can use serial ports communication by installing apps like `teraterm`(for windows) `GTKterm` (for linux)
## OS support
* xlinx provides a pe-buit OS images like `ubuntu`, `embedded linux`(build using yocto) and `peta linux`.
* it is important that we should use the boot firmware(QSPI in SOM) recommended by a specific OS
* boot fimware can be updated using `xmutils` or `boot image recovery tool`
* but we can't use that when we are using a custom hardware accelerator(fpga). here we need to create a custom os which can interact with hardware accelerator
* `petalinux` is an Embedded Linux development tool focused on Xilinx silicons and device specific feature enablement via board support packages (BSPs) and pre-built reference(s). 
* `Yocto` is another tool to create our own fully custom embedded Linux. 

## Hardware-Accelerated Applications
Hardware acceleration means offloading specific computations from the CPU to specialized hardware like GPUs, FPGAs, or ASICs for improved performance, power efficiency, and parallel processing.
### steps to create hardware accelareted applications for kv260 
* In Vivado, create an FPGA logic for hardware acceleration(in PL) and its communication setup with the ARM CPU(PS)
* Export the IP block developed in vivado and integrate it into a Vitis platform.
* In Vitis, develop an application to control the FPGA logic from the CPU.
* load the FPGA configuration bitstream to SOC
* Run the Linux application to communicate with the FPGA accelerator.

The API calls, managed by XRT, are used to process transactions between the host program and the hardware accelerators. Communication between the host and the kernel, including control and data transfers, occurs across the PCIe® bus or an AXI bus for embedded platforms. Control information is written to or read from specific address-mapped register in the kernels. Data buffers are exchanged between the host and kernels through global memory. Global memory is accessible by both the host processor and hardware accelerators, while host memory is only accessible by the host application.

### doubts
- is it possible to impliment cpu cores on FPGA fabric 
    - yes,we can impliment cpu cores on FPGA fabric using VHDL/Verilog, it is called as `soft processor cores`.it has some pros and cons compared to `hard processor cores`
    MicroBlaze (Xilinx) – A 32-bit RISC processor used in Xilinx FPGAs.
    - eg:
        - Nios II (Intel/Altera) – A configurable 32-bit soft-core for Intel FPGAs.
        - VexRISC-V – A small and efficient RISC-V soft-core.
        - PicoRV32 – A lightweight RISC-V implementation.
- we dont have to impliment a processor core for running apps in our FPGA fabric if we have a `hard processor core` in it 
- do GPU have a cpu in it: no
