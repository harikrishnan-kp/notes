# Kria KV260 Vision AI Starter Kit
* Kria KV260 Vision is a development kit from AMD
* consist of Kria K26 SOM(system on module) by AMD
* power supply : 12v, 3A
* KV260 is based on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC, it has a Processing System (PS) + Programmable Logic (PL) architecture
* this PL section is the fpga section, we can use vivado for implimenting the hardware acceleration ( in our case AI accelerator)
* `DPU` deep learning processing unit
* xlinx provides a ported ubuntu os for easy usage
* but we can't use that when we are using a custom hardware accelerator(fpga)
* here we need to create a custom os which can interact with hardware accelerator, petalinux is the tool we can use for this 
* The KV260 Starter Kit has a primary and secondary boot device, isolating the boot firmware from the run-time OS and application
