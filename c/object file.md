# object file
- object file is an intermediate file generated as the output of assembler during the build process.
- the object code (typically a `.o` or `.obj` file) consists of several sections that contain different types of information.
- These sections are used by the linker to generate the final executable. The key sections in an object file are:

1. Text Section (.text)

    Contains the machine code (binary instructions) generated from the C source code.
    This section is read-only and executed at runtime.
    Includes functions and code written by the programmer.

2. Data Section

This section contains initialized global and static variables. It is further divided into:

* .data (Initialized Data Section)
    Stores initialized global and static variables (e.g., int x = 10;).
    Read-write section.
* .rodata (Read-Only Data Section)
    Stores constant values, including string literals (printf("Hello");).
    Usually read-only to prevent modification at runtime.

3. BSS Section (.bss)

    Stores uninitialized global and static variables.
    These variables are initialized to zero by the runtime before execution.
    Does not occupy space in the object file but is allocated memory at runtime.

4. Symbol Table (.symtab)

    Contains information about functions, global variables, and their addresses.
    Useful for debugging and linking but not included in the final executable.
    Can be viewed using tools like nm or objdump.

5. Relocation Table (.rel.text, .rel.data, etc.)

    Used for relocating addresses of variables and functions when linking multiple object files.
    Helps the linker resolve external references (e.g., function calls to external libraries).

6. Debugging Information (.debug)

    Only present if compiled with debugging flags (-g in GCC).
    Stores source-level debugging information, such as variable names and line numbers.
    Used by debuggers like gdb.

7. Other Sections

    .comment – Stores compiler version and build information.
    .note – Metadata like build ID, OS version, etc.
    .plt (Procedure Linkage Table) – Used for dynamically linking functions at runtime.

Viewing Object File Sections

You can inspect an object file's sections using:

    objdump -h file.o (Linux)
    readelf -S file.o (Linux)
    nm file.o (Shows symbols)
    dumpbin /headers file.obj (Windows)

## types of object files
- relocatable: non executable file that need to be linked into another file
- executable: executable binary program
- shared object:these are shared libraries (for dynamic linking)
